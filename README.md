Small app to share what you're currently listening to (Music app only!)

After unsubscribing from Apple Music, there wasn't a quick way to share what I'm currnetly listening to with friends. With Apple Music you can share the iTunes link which is formatted nicely within the Messages app. Missing that feature quite a lot, I whipped up the majority of this app within a few hours just to restore this functionality. 

### To-Do
- [ ] Make the app look prettier.
- [ ] Add settings pane - customise the string, include artwork, etc.
- [ ] Resize image when sharing - 1280x1280 artwork is probably a little excessive and is quite large when sharing in Messages.
